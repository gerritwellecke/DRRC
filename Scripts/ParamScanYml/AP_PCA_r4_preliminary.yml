Reservoir:
  winsize: 2 #number of variables that a reservoir sees from outside the region where its predicting for sync.
  #fracin: 0.5 #fraction of variables that actually enters the reservoir after dimension reduction
  #spectral: 0.1 #spectral radius, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix
  degree: 3 #average degree of the adjacency matrix
  #inscale: 0.01 #input scaling the maximal absolute value of entries in the input matrix
  #leakage: 0.95 #leakage the strength of memory a reservoir state remembers old excitations with (0.0 only driven from new data no memory, 1.0 no update of rs)
  #regularization: 1.0e-4 #regularization strength for the ridge regression
  transform: "pca" #which transform should be applied for dimension reduction
  trainonly: False #whether the script should train the system only (True) or also write metrics (False)
  replicas: [4,4] #the amount of reservoirs per dimension that should be used together as a multi-reservoir (for ex. [2,1] in 2D case for 2 reservoirs in x direction)
  combine: False #whether we train each domain with a separate reservoir (False) or one reservoir on all domains (true)
  inputadjdiff: False #whether we use different input matrices and adjacency matrices for each reservoir
  dense: False #whether the adjacency matrix is sparse (False) or dense (True)
  overwrite: False #instead of trying to load a model learns a model anew 
  biasscale: null #scaling of the bias strength double the maximal absolute value of the bias input to a reservoir node, None defaults to inscale
  fitsignal: True #whether to also fit the input signal for predicting the next timestep
  dtype: "float" #datatype to use for encoding everything from reservoir state to training data
